          We believe that <strong>time</strong> is the most important resource
          one can have. Thatâ€™s why you should not use it for
          <strong>cleaning your home</strong>, but for doing what you like.
          Finding a trustworthy person to clean your house or office is usually
          time consuming. Besides of that, you can never be sure if the person
          you contact will do their job properly. Out of a desire to have more

        <div class="TextClass AlignLeft">
          <div class="Tab">
            <strong>The first step in identifying the problem</strong> was a
            brainstorming session with the team where we tried to identify an
            important field which needs a change.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            From our experience, there is a problem in finding a suitable person
            for cleaning our houses. This is caused by the lack of exposure for
            housekeepers. The cumbersome process of finding a housekeeper made
            us consider this issue as one of substantial interest which needs
            solving.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            In the past, the communication between the two parts was
            intermediated by cleaning agencies which compile CVs of several
            housekeepers. Recently, the market suffered changes leading to
            different demands. This way of finding and booking services became
            inefficient and customers crave a new way of doing business.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            Global digitalization trends have made their presence felt in this
            field as well. Nowadays people find housekeepers by searching
            through Facebook groups or on other platforms such as OLX. There is
            a lack of platforms designed to encourage communication between the
            two parts involved in this type of business.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            Market research shows the inefficiency of existing platforms, which
            do not provide transparency in choosing a housekeeper. These provide
            a rudimentary allocation process which only focuses on meeting
            supply and demand without accounting for particularities between
            customers. Such a process usually assigns subpar services to picky
            clients generating dissatisfaction.

            In order to create a middle ground between housekeepers and

            cleaning persons can join and one can book them.

            <li>

            Based on the answers, we can conclude that the previous experience
            of other people is very important for other clients. This made us

            What will differentiate us from these already existing solutions, from the 
            point of view of businesses, will be the ability to rate and review housekeepers.
            Based on this system clients will have the opportunity to choose a housekeeper. 
            Also, the housekeepers will do their services right, not to have a bad reputation.
