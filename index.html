          We believe that <strong>time</strong> is the most important resource one can have. Thatâ€™s
          why you should not use it for <strong>cleaning your home</strong>, but for doing what you
          like. Finding a trustworthy person to clean your house or office is
          usually time consuming. Besides of that, you can never be sure if the
          person you contact will do their job properly. Out of a desire to have

              <strong>The first step in identifying the problem</strong> was a brainstorming session with the team where we tried to identify an important field which needs a change. 
            </div>
            <div class="Tab">
              From our experience, there is a problem in finding a suitable person for cleaning our houses. This is caused by the lack of exposure for housekeepers. The cumbersome process of finding a housekeeper made us consider this issue as one of substantial interest which needs solving.
            </div>
            <div class="Tab">
              In the past, the communication between the two parts was intermediated by cleaning agencies which compile CVs of several housekeepers. Recently, the market suffered changes leading to different demands. This way of finding and booking services became inefficient and customers crave a new way of doing business.
            </div>
            <div class="Tab">
              Global digitalization trends have made their presence felt in this field as well. Nowadays people find housekeepers by searching through Facebook groups or on other platforms such as OLX. There is a lack of platforms designed to encourage communication between the two parts involved in this type of business. 
            </div>
            <div class="Tab">
              Market research shows the inefficiency of existing platforms, which do not provide transparency in choosing a housekeeper. These provide a rudimentary allocation process which only focuses on meeting supply and demand without accounting for particularities between customers. Such a process usually assigns subpar services to picky clients generating dissatisfaction.  
            </div>
            <div class="Tab">
              <strong>Limpid seeks to meet the quality standards the existing customers demand.</strong> Our goal is to achieve this, while also reaping the flexibility improvements a mobile application provides.

              In order to create a middle ground between housekeepers and customers, our proposal is to develop a mobile application where cleaning persons can join and one can book them.

            We decided to split the problem validation into <strong>two different parts:</strong>

            <li>On the other hand, we wanted to <strong>research if the house cleaners would use our application to have their services booked.</strong></li>

          Firstly, we wanted to see the age distribution of our survey subjects. The majority of people who answered our survey seem to be young, with ages between 18-24 years. However, 3.4% of respondents are in the age group of more than 55 years. This shows us the wide interest of people disregarding the age group.

          Our research shows variance amid the cleaning habits of our respondents. Even more fascinating is the balanced spread between the once a week, every two weeks and once a month options.      
        </div>
        <div class="BlueTextParagraph">
          Some of the possible clients added new intervals to our question: every three months and once a year. This is one reason why we want to offer flexibility in application and many options for them to choose.

          From the chart below we can conclude that people are still willing to turn to new housekeepers if the person they usually work with is not available.

            An important question in our form is about the problems respondents encountered when they worked with a housekeeper. We can see that many of them are interested in this kind of service even though they haven't used it yet.

          <div class="BlueTextParagraph">
            Based on this research we found out a common problem among them, the quality of the services is not the expected one. Another important issue is regarding the availability of the housekeeper.

          <div class="BlueTextParagraph">
            Based on the answer below, the most used method to reach a new house cleaner is by asking a close person. This proves that the application is necessary and will bring value to this domain.

          <div class="BlueTextParagraph">
            Based on the answers, we can conclude that the previous experience of other people is very important for other clients. This made us believe that the feedback section for every cleaner would really help the clients to choose a person for cleaning their houses.

            The research shows that the respondents are willing to use a platform to book this service instead of using the inefficient method of searching on Facebook groups or OLX. More than a half of the answers were for 4 or 5 options, which encourage the potential of this kind of mobile application.

            Most people who answered our survey as housekeepers are in the age group between 35 and 44 years. On the second level come the group with age between 45 and 54 years and then the group with age between 25 and 34 years.

            Since time is the most important resource one can have, we thought the time of housekeepers is an essential aspect we should know about. 
          </div>
          <div class="BlueTextParagraph">
            We can recognize the balanced spread between all the options. Our respondents are willing to work 10 to 20 hours per week, assuming this would be an additional source of income. The next percentage is for those who can allocate 30 to 40 hours per week, the time for a full time job. Moreover, some of the respondents would work more than 40 hours per week.
