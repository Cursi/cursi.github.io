      <div class="TextClass AlignLeft">
        We believe that <strong>time</strong> is the most important resource one can have. Thatâ€™s
        why you should not use it for <strong>cleaning your home</strong>, but for doing what you
        like. Finding a trustworthy person to clean your house or office is
        usually time consuming. Besides of that, you can never be sure if the
        person you contact will do their job properly. Out of a desire to have
        more time for yourself, we created <strong>Limpid</strong>.

        <strong>Limpid</strong> is a platform where cleaning persons can join and you can book
        them. On this platform you will be able to <strong>pick</strong> your favorite person based
        on the <strong>reviews</strong>. You will be charged on <strong>square feet</strong> based on the <strong>levels of dirtness</strong>.

        The main advantage we have over the competition is <strong>transparency</strong> in the
        sense that our clients can select the cleaner for their house based on the
        <strong>reviews</strong>. Every cleaner will have the option to set his <strong>own price</strong> for his
        work.

      <div class="SectionTitle ">Identifying the problem</div>
        <div class="TextClass AlignLeft">
          <div class="Tab">
            <strong>The first step in identifying the problem</strong> was a brainstorming session with the team where we tried to identify an important field which needs a change. 
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            From our experience, there is a problem in finding a suitable person for cleaning our houses. This is caused by the lack of exposure for housekeepers. The cumbersome process of finding a housekeeper made us consider this issue as one of substantial interest which needs solving.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            In the past, the communication between the two parts was intermediated by cleaning agencies which compile CVs of several housekeepers. Recently, the market suffered changes leading to different demands. This way of finding and booking services became inefficient and customers crave a new way of doing business.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            Global digitalization trends have made their presence felt in this field as well. Nowadays people find housekeepers by searching through Facebook groups or on other platforms such as OLX. There is a lack of platforms designed to encourage communication between the two parts involved in this type of business. 
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            Market research shows the inefficiency of existing platforms, which do not provide transparency in choosing a housekeeper. These provide a rudimentary allocation process which only focuses on meeting supply and demand without accounting for particularities between customers. Such a process usually assigns subpar services to picky clients generating dissatisfaction.  
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            <strong>Limpid seeks to meet the quality standards the existing customers demand.</strong> Our goal is to achieve this, while also reaping the flexibility improvements a mobile application provides.

        <div class="TextClass AlignLeft">
          <div class="Tab">
            In order to create a middle ground between housekeepers and customers, our proposal is to develop a mobile application where cleaning persons can join and one can book them.
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            On this platform one will be able to pick their favorite person based on the reviews. They will be charged on square feet based on the levels of dirtiness,<strong> but the price will be set by the cleaning person, not by us.</strong>

      <div class="SectionTitle">Plan for customer discovery</div>
      <div class="TextClass AlignLeft">
        <ul id="KeyMetricsList" class="TextClass AlignLeft">
          We decided to split the problem validation into <strong>two different parts:</strong>
          <li>On one hand, we wanted to <strong>validate the fact that customers cannot easily find a housekeeper.</strong> Also, our goal was to discover what other major problems they encountered when working with different house cleaners.</li>
          <li>On the other hand, we wanted to <strong>research if the house cleaners would use our application to have their services booked.</strong></li>
        </ul>

          <div class="Tab">
            We reached both segments of clients by creating an online questionnaire to help us identify their problems. Based on their experiences and needs, we will create the features of the application. 
          </div>
          <div class="Tab">
            Facebook was the principal method to reach the people in need for this service. The questionnaire was posted on several groups intended for cleaning services.
